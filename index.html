    <h1>My very first webpage on Scrimba!!!</h1>
    
    <h2>Tag levels range from one (above) to six (below)</h2>

    <h6>I am the deepest level of heading tag</h6>

    <p>
      While the browser can be very forgiving and will render what's inside a 'h7' you will not be able to style it because it's not a valid tag.
