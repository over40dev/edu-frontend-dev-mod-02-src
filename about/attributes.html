<h1>Attributes</h1>

<p>
  Attributes are the way you tell the browser where you want to go.
</p>

<p>
  Always include <strong>attribute</strong> in the opening tag. 
</p>

<p>
  Attributes are usually followed by equal sign and quotation marks. Inside the quotation marks is the value to be assigned to the attribute.
</p>

<p>
  Example attribute for '<>' tag is the <strong>href</strong>
  From Example:
  <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>
</p>

<p>
  Some elements, such as the '<a>' tag require an attribute. Without the <strong>href</strong> attribute the anchor will not even render as a link.
